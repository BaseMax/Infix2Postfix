# Infix To Postfix Converter (Infix2Postfix)

This is a simple infix to postfix converter written in JavaScript.

It is a simple project that I made to show other students how they can easily design this type of program and how they can use it to solve their problems.

## How to use

1. Clone the repository
2. Enter your infix expression in the example.js file
2. Run `Infix2Postfix.js` and `example.js` in your terminal
3. You will get the postfix expression

## Example

### Input

```js
const infix = "a+b*c-d/e";
```
